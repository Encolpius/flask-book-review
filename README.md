# Project 1

This project was created for the edX CS50 Web Programming with Python and JavaScript course. In this project, we were assigned to create a website using Flask and create a book review site. Taking a long list of books, we imported the books into a database, created users, and utilized the Goodreads API to pull in information Goodreads has available for each book.

The project consists of the following folders:

__pycache__
  - compiled Python files

flask_session 
  - to hold information regarding Sessions

static
  - To hold the CSS files

As well as the following fils:

application.py holds the functions and methods needed to run the project;
books.csv contains the books imported for the project;
import.py holds the code that imported the books to the database;
requirements contains dependencies needed to run the program and contains the following: 
  1. Flask
  2. Flask-session
  3. psycopg2-binary
  4. SQAlchemy


Enjoy,
